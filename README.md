# PixelWalker Protocol

## Introduction
PixelWalker uses [Protobuf v3]([url](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/)) for communication between the client and game server. You can use the `.proto` file in this repository to generate classes. There are some third party libraries that have been developed for ease of use that you can inquire about joining our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rDgtbbzDqX).

## Useful Resources
### Authentication
In order to retrieve the latest room type, please see this [endpoint]([url](https://game.pixelwalker.net/listroomtypes)) from the game server.
### Blocks
If you're looking for all the block palette mappings, please see the [mappings endpoint]([url](https://game.pixelwalker.net/mappings)) from the game server. This can be referenced in your program so you always have the most up-to-date mappings, as numerical block ids are subject to change.
